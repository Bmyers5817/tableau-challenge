# tableau-challenge

I had originally downloaded all files from 2015 to the current month of April 2021 and recognized pretty quickly that a big part of this challenge was the amount of data available.  Due to limitations with Tableau (maximum of 15,000,000 rows), I pared my selection of data from Sepember 2020 through April 2021.  My selection includes 12.8 million rows of data.

Files were downloaded and imported into Python to concatonate and modify the Gender field from a numeric value to string values.

As data was brought into Tableau, there were a few fields that needed to be converted into Dimensions rather than Measures (Bikeid, End Station id, and Start Station id).

Several vizualizations were created to evaluate usage of Citi Bikes.  The Usage Story includes 4 visuals with notations of what usage was by month, weekday, gender, and hour (including user type).  The Usage by Age Story with evaluation notes shows anomolies with the data.  On elast user story includes the top 25 starting and ending stations - which appear to benearly the same amount of usage, showing that users return bikes to the same location originally rented.
